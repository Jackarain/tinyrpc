[section:TlsContext TlsContext concept]

`TlsContext` represents an object that defines the user's configuration for establishing TLS/SSL connections.
If TLS/SSL is not required, this parameter defaults to `std::monostate`.

The __Client__ treats the `TlsContext` object as an opaque entity.
It is primarily utilized when creating the underlying transport stream and is not directly manipulated by the __Client__.

For instance, establishing a secure connection using using __SSL_STREAM__ requires __SSL_CONTEXT__ as the `TlsContext` type.
An example of this can be found in the [link mqtt5.hello_world_over_tls hello_world_over_tls.cpp] example.
