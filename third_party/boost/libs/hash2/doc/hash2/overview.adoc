# Overview
:idprefix: overview_

This library implements an extensible framework for implementing
hashing algorithms that can support user-defined types. Its structure
is largely based on the paper http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3980.html["Types don't know #"]
by Howard Hinnant, Vinnie Falco and John Bytheway.

The key feature of the design is the clean separation between the _hash
algorithm_, which takes an untyped stream of bytes (a _message_) and produces
a hash value (a _message digest_), and the `hash_append` function, which takes
a type and is responsible for turning the value of this type into a
sequence of bytes and feeding them to a _hash algorithm_.

This allows hashing support for user-defined types to be written once,
and then automatically being usable with any hash algorithms, even such
that weren't yet available at the time the type was defined.

The following popular hashing algorithms are provided:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function[FNV-1a]
* https://cyan4973.github.io/xxHash/[xxHash]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash[SipHash]
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1321[MD5]
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3174[SHA-1]
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6234[SHA-2]
* https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/202/final[SHA-3]
* https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/%7Ebosselae/ripemd160.html[RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-128]
* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104[HMAC]

but it's also possible for users to write their own; as long as the
hash algorithm conforms to the concept, `hash_append` will work with it,
and so will all user-defined types that support `hash_append`.
