# Hashing Byte Sequences
:idprefix: hashing_bytes_

This library addresses two major use cases: hashing an untyped sequence
of bytes, and hashing {cpp} objects.

Untyped byte sequences (also called _messages_) are hashed by passing
them to a _hash algorithm_, which then produces a hash value (or a
_message digest_).

The same _hash algorithm_, when passed the same _message_, will always
produce the same _digest_. (Published algorithms provide _message_ and
corresponding _digest_ pairs, called _test vectors_, to enable
verification of independent implementations.)

(To hash a {cpp} object, it's first converted (serialized) to a sequence
of bytes, then passed to a _hash algorithm_.)

## Hash Algorithm Requirements

A _hash algorithm_ must have the following structure, and meet the
following minimum requirements:

```
struct HashAlgorithm
{
    using result_type = /*integral or array-like*/;

    static constexpr std::size_t block_size = /*...*/; // optional

    HashAlgorithm();
    explicit HashAlgorithm( std::uint64_t seed );
    HashAlgorithm( void const* seed, std::size_t n );

    HashAlgorithm( HashAlgorithm const& r );
    HashAlgorithm& operator=( HashAlgorithm const& r );

    void update( void const* data, std::size_t n );

    result_type result();
};
```

### result_type

The nested type `result_type` is the type of the produced hash value. It
can be an unsigned integer type (that is not `bool`), typically
`std::uint32_t` or `std::uint64_t`, or a `std::array`-like type with a
value type of `unsigned char`.

Normally, non-cryptographic hash functions have an integer `result_type`,
and cryptographic hash functions have an array-like `result_type`, but
that's not required.

The provided utility function `get_integral_result` can be used to obtain
an integer hash value from any valid `result_type`.

### block_size

Cryptographic hash functions provide a `block_size` value, which is their
block size (e.g. 64 for MD5, 128 for SHA2-512) and is required in order
to implement the corresponding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC[HMAC].

`block_size` is an optional requirement.

### Default Constructor

All _hash algorithms_ must be default constructible. The default
constructor initializes the internal state of the hash algorithm to its
initial values, as published in its specification.

For example, the default constructor of `md5_128` corresponds to calling
the function `MD5_Init` of the reference implementation.

### Constructor Taking an Integer Seed

All _hash algorithms_ must be constructible from a value of type
`std::uint64_t`, which serves as a seed.

Using a seed value of 0 is equivalent to default construction.

Distinct seed values cause the internal state to be initialized differently,
and therefore, instances of the hash algorithm initialized by different seeds
produce different hash values when passed the same message.

Seeding using random (unobservable from the outside) values is useful for
preventing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#Hash_flooding[hash flooding attacks].

### Constructor Taking a Byte Sequence Seed

All _hash algorithms_ can be constructed from a seed sequence of
`unsigned char` values (this makes all hash algorithms
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyed_hash_function[keyed hash functions].)

A null sequence (one with length 0) produces a default-constructed instance.

Different seed sequences produce differently initialized instances.

While this requirement makes all hash algorithms usable as MACs
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code[Message Authentication Codes]),
you should as a general rule prefer an established MAC algorithm, such as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC[HMAC]. (A HMAC implementation is provided.)

### Copy Constructor, Copy Assignment

Hash algorithms are copy constructible and copy assignable, providing the
usual guarantees for these operations. That is, a copy is equivalent to the
original.

### update

The function `update` is the mechanism by which the input message is provided
to the hash algorithm.

Calling `update` several times is equivalent to calling it once with the
concatenated byte sequences from the individual calls. That is, the input
message may be provided in parts, and the way it's split into parts does
not matter and does not affect the final hash value.

Given
```
Hash hash; // some hash algorithm
unsigned char message[6] = { /*...*/ }; // some input message
```
the following `update` call
```
hash.update( message, 6 );
```
is equivalent to
```
hash.update( message, 4 );
hash.update( message + 4, 2 );
```
and to
```
for( int i = 0; i < 6; ++i ) hash.update( &message[i], 1 );
```

### result

After the entire input message has been provided via calls to `update`, the
final hash value can be obtained by calling `result`.

The call to `result` finalizes the internal state, by padding the message as
per the concrete algorithm specification, by optionally incorporating the
length of the message into the state, and by performing finalization
operations on the state, again as specified by the concrete algorithm.

A final hash value is then obtained by transforming the internal state, and
returned.

Note that `result` is non-const, because it changes the internal state. It's
allowed for `result` to be called more than once; subsequent calls perform
the state finalization again and as a result produce a pseudorandom sequence
of `result_type` values. This can be used to effectively extend the output of
the hash function. For example, a 256 bit result can be obtained from a hash
algorithm whose `result_type` is 64 bit, by calling `result` four times.

As a toy example, _not intended for production use_, this is how one could
write a random number generator on top of the FNV-1a implementation provided
by the library:

```
std::uint64_t random()
{
    static boost::hash2::fnv1a_64 hash;
    return hash.result();
}
```

## Compile Time Hashing

Under {cpp}14, it's possible to invoke some hash algorithms at compile time.
These algorithms provide the following interface:

```
struct HashAlgorithm
{
    using result_type = /*integral or array-like*/;

    static constexpr std::size_t block_size = /*...*/; // optional

    constexpr HashAlgorithm();
    explicit constexpr HashAlgorithm( std::uint64_t seed );
    HashAlgorithm( void const* seed, std::size_t n );
    constexpr HashAlgorithm( unsigned char const* seed, std::size_t n );

    constexpr HashAlgorithm( HashAlgorithm const& r );
    constexpr HashAlgorithm& operator=( HashAlgorithm const& r );

    void update( void const* data, std::size_t n );
    constexpr void update( unsigned char const* data, std::size_t n );

    constexpr result_type result();
};
```

Apart from the added `constexpr` qualifiers, the only difference is that
the byte seed constructor and `update` have a second overload that takes
`unsigned char const*` instead of `void const*`.
(Pointers to `void` cannot be used in `constexpr` functions before {cpp}26.)

## Provided Hash Algorithms

### FNV-1a

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function[Fowler-Noll-Vo hash function]
is provided as a representative of the class of hash functions that process
their input one byte at a time. The 32 or 64 bit state is updated for each
input character `ch` by using the operation `state = (state ^ ch) * fnv_prime`.

FNV-1a is non-cryptographic, relatively weak compared to state of the art
hash functions (although good for its class), but fast when the input strings
are short.

### xxHash

https://xxhash.com/[xxHash] is a fast non-cryptographic hashing algorithm by Yann Collet.

Its speed (~5GB/s for `xxhash_32`, ~10GB/s for `xxhash_64` on a Xeon E5-2683 v4 @ 2.10GHz)
makes it well suited for quick generation of file or data integrity checksums.

### SipHash

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash[SipHash] by Jean-Philippe Aumasson and Daniel J. Bernstein
(https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/351[paper]) has been designed to thwart
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#Hash_flooding[hash flooding attacks] against hash tables that receive
external untrusted input (e.g. HTTP message headers, or JSON objects.)

It's not a cryptographic hash function (even though its design is similar to one),
because it does not provide collision resistance when the initial seed is known.

It is, however, a cryptographically strong keyed hash function (or a pseudorandom function, PRF).
If the initial seed is unknown to the attacker, it's computationally difficult to engineer a collision, or to recover the seed by observing the output.

SipHash has been adopted as the de-facto standard hash function for hash tables that can be exposed to external input,
and is used in Python, Perl, Ruby, Rust, and other languages.

SipHash is the recommended hash function for hash tables exposed to external input. As a best practice, it should be seeded with a random value that varies per connection, and not a fixed one per process.

### MD5

Designed in 1991 by Ron Rivest, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5[MD5] used
to be the best known and the most widely used https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function[cryptographic hash function],
but has been broken and is no longer considered cryptographic for any purposes.
It produces a 128 bit digest.

MD5 should no longer be used in new code when cryptographic strength is required, except when implementing an existing
specification or protocol that calls for its use.

Prefer SHA2-512/256 (or SHA2-256 in 32 bit code) instead.

If you require a digest of exactly 128 bits, use RIPEMD-128 instead.
Do note that 128 bit digests are no longer considered cryptographic, because attacks with a complexity of 2^64^ are within the capabilities of well-funded attackers.

### SHA-1

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1[SHA-1] is a cryptographic hash function that was designed by NSA and
https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/180-1/final[published] in 1995 by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST[NIST]
as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard[Federal Information Processing Standard] (FIPS).
It produces a 160 bit digest.

SHA-1 is now considered insecure against a well-funded attacker, and should no
longer be used in new code. Prefer SHA2-512/256, SHA2-256 in 32 bit code, or, if
you require a digest of exactly 160 bits, RIPEMD-160 instead.

### SHA-2

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2[SHA-2] is a family of cryptographic hash functions, also designed by NSA,
https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/180-2/upd1/final[initially published] by NIST in 2002,
and https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/180-4/upd1/final[updated] in 2015.
It includes SHA2-224, SHA2-256, SHA2-384, SHA2-512, SHA2-512/224, and SHA2-512/256, each producing a digest with the corresponding bit length.

Of these, SHA2-256 and SHA2-512 are the basis ones, and the rest are variants with the digest truncated.

The SHA-2 functions haven't been broken and are in wide use, despite the existence of a newer standard (SHA-3).

SHA2-256 and its truncated variant SHA2-224 use 32 bit operations and therefore do not lose performance on a 32 bit platform.

SHA2-512 and its truncated variants SHA2-384, SHA2-512/224, and SHA2-512/256 use 64 bit operations and are approximately 1.5 times as fast
as SHA2-256 on a 64 bit platform, but twice as slow in 32 bit code.

On 64 bit platforms, SHA2-512/256 and SHA2-512/224 should be preferred over SHA2-256 and SHA2-224 not just because of speed, but because
they are resistant to length extension attacks as they don't expose all of the bits of their internal state in the final digest.

### SHA-3

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3[SHA-3] is the most recent addition to the Secure Hash Algorithm standards, published in 2015
as https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/202/final[FIPS 202].

SHA-3 includes 6 algorithms: SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, SHAKE128, and SHAKE256.

The SHA3 functions output a fixed-sized digest while SHAKE128 and SHAKE256 are approved extendable-output functions, also known as XOFs. XOFs permit generation
of an arbitrarily long message digest in a defined manner.

Unlike SHA-2, SHA3-224 is not a truncated version of the SHA3-256 algorithm. Instead, all SHA-3 algorithms create their digests by truncating the
lower portion of the 1600-bit state permuted by the Keccak algorithm. The XOFs return their digests incrementally as fixed-sized blocks, using the truncation specified
in Algorithm 8, step 8 of FIPS 202.

SHA-3 uses 64 bit operations for all of the algorithms in the family.

### RIPEMD-160, RIPEMD-128

Designed in 1996, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPEMD[RIPEMD-160] is a cryptographic hash function that was less well known than MD5 and SHA-1,
but that has recently become popular because of its use in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Even though it hasn't been broken, there's no reason to prefer its use in new code over SHA-2.

RIPEMD-128 is a truncated variant of RIPEMD-160. (Do note that 128 bit digests are no longer considered cryptographic, because attacks with a complexity of 2^64^ are within the capabilities of well-funded attackers.)

### HMAC

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC[HMAC] (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is an algorithm for deriving
a _message authentication code_ by using a cryptographic hash function. It's described in https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2104[RFC 2104].

A message authentication code differs from a digest by the fact that it depends on both the contents of the message
and on a secret _key_; in contrast, a message digest only depends on the contents of the message.

Even though all hash algorithms provided by the library can be used to produce message authentication codes,
by means of seeding the hash algorithm initially with a secret key by calling the constructor taking a byte
sequence, hash algorithms have usually not been designed to be used in this manner, and such use hasn't been
cryptographically analyzed and vetted. (SipHash is an exception; it has specifically been designed as a MAC.)

The HMAC algorithm is provided in the form of a class template `hmac<H>` that adapts a cryptographic hash
algorithm `H`. `hmac<H>` satisfies the requirements of a cryptographic hash algorithm.

Convenience aliases of common HMAC instantiations are provided. For example, the `md5.hpp` header defining
`md5_128` also defines `hmac_md5_128` as an alias to `hmac<md5_128>`.

## Choosing a Hash Algorithm

If your use case requires cryptographic strength, use SHA2-512/256 (or SHA2-256 in 32 bit code) for digests, and the corresponding HMAC for message authentication codes.

NOTE: Digests of fewer than 256 bits in length are no longer recommended when cryptographic security is required or desired.

For computing file or content checksums, when speed is of the essence and externally induced collisions aren't a concern, use xxHash-64.

NOTE: xxHash-32 will be faster in 32 bit code, but since it only produces a 32 bit result, collisions will become an issue when the number of items reaches tens of thousands, which is usually unacceptable.

For a large number of items (many millions), 64 bits may not be enough; in that case, use either MD5, or xxHash-64, <<example_result_extension,extended to 128 bits>>.

NOTE: Even though MD5 is no longer cryptographically secure, it can still be used when cryptographic strength is not a requirement.

For hash tables, use SipHash by default, <<example_use_with_unordered_containers,with a random (unpredictable from the outside) seed>> that varies per connection or per container. Avoid using a fixed processwide seed. Never use SipHash without a seed.

For hash tables with very short keys (3-4-5 bytes), unexposed to external input, you can use FNV-1a, although the default hash function of e.g. `boost::unordered_flat_map` will typically perform better.
